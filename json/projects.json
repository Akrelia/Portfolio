    "description": "My first commercially released game <u>ever</u>.<br><br> A childhood dream. I'm so proud of it because it was a long process on all levels of video game conception, especially <b>Game Design</b>. I learned so much while developing it that I couldn't conceive it, and I understand why in the world of computer science and especially in the world of video games, there is a huge difference between a <b>finished game</b> and an incomplete one. <br><br>Anyway, it's a game where you have to draw platforms to help a country go as high as possible, even reach space. However, the rocket at your disposal is useless, and your platform fuel is limited. So, you'll have to scrape together coins to upgrade everything and go higher and higher! You can try it right here on the <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TheCauldron.CountryBallSpaceRace'>Play Store</a>.",

As it evolved, I thought of making a public version for everyone to play as well. It's quite a project, and although it could use some graphical improvements, I'm really proud of it. <a href='http://www.planquiz.fr'> Why not give it a try </a>?",

I've been a huge player since 2005, and it's thanks to this game that I started delving into programming. It was on this game that I encountered my first hacker, and it fascinated me to see people who weren't restricted by the game's rules.<br> When the official servers closed, players were left high and dry and started wanting to create private servers. It became a race to see who would make the first true Rose emulator. Since I was just starting out in programming and knew the game well, I naturally started working on a community emulator project. So, that's how I got into programming, by creating an emulator. It's probably the worst way to start programming, but you have to start somewhere! However, the official source code leaked, so there was no need for an emulator anymore. <br><br>Finally, during the <b>Covid</b> lockdown, I had some time to kill, and after years of experience, I wanted to challenge myself: to recreate a <b>Rose emulator</b> from scratch! And after weeks and weeks of hard work, I FINALLY managed to make something that works.",
